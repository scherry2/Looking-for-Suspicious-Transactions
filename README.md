## Fraud During 7am to 9am
When looking at the highest 100 transactions from 7am to 9am, it seems like there are some possible fradulent activities. A few merchants had transactions that were extraordinary high compared to the other transactions in the same time frame. There were only 8 transactions over $700, while the other 92 transactions did not exceed more than $100.
